# Gemini Code Assistant Report

## Project Overview

This project is a Rust library for **Rational Trigonometry**, an alternative to classical trigonometry that uses rational numbers and operations. The library provides functions for calculating key concepts in rational trigonometry, such as `quadrance`, `spread`, and `cross`. The code is well-documented and includes a comprehensive test suite.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Language:** Rust
*   **Core Dependencies:**
    *   `num-traits`: For generic numeric operations.
    *   `num-rational`: For working with rational numbers (in dev-dependencies, but used in examples).
    *   `fractions-rs`: For working with fractions (in dev-dependencies).

**Architecture:**

The project is structured as a simple Rust library. The main logic is encapsulated in the `trigonom` module (`src/trigonom.rs`), which is then exposed through the main library file `src/lib.rs`. The library is designed to be generic, allowing it to work with various numeric types that implement the necessary traits.

## Building and Running

### Building the Project

To build the project, use the following command:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```sh
cargo test
```

### Using the Library

To use this library in your own project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rat-trig-rs = "0.1.1"
```

Then, you can use the functions from the library in your code like this:

```rust
use rat_trig_rs::trigonom::{quadrance, spread};

fn main() {
    let p1 = (1, 1);
    let p2 = (4, 5);
    let q = quadrance(p1, p2);
    println!("Quadrance: {}", q);

    let v1 = (1.0, 1.0);
    let v2 = (1.0, 0.0);
    let s = spread(v1, v2);
    println!("Spread: {}", s);
}
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Coding Style:** The code follows standard Rust conventions, with a focus on clear and concise code.
*   **Testing:** The project has a comprehensive test suite that covers all the main functions. Tests are located in the same files as the code they are testing, under a `#[cfg(test)]` module.
*   **Contributions:** The project has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that outlines the contribution process. Contributions are expected to be dual-licensed under Apache-2.0 and MIT.

## Code Optimization

The following optimizations have been performed on the codebase:

*   **Inlining:** All functions in `src/trigonom.rs` have been marked with `#[inline]` to reduce function call overhead.
*   **Code Reuse:** The `spread_from_line`, `quadrance_from_line`, and `cross_from_line` functions have been refactored to reuse the `quadrance` and `cross` functions, reducing code duplication and potentially improving performance.
*   **Release Profile:** A `[profile.release]` section has been added to `Cargo.toml` to enable Link-Time Optimization (LTO), reduce the number of code generation units, and set the panic strategy to `abort`. These settings can lead to significant performance improvements in release builds.
